      "text": "I tested Seedance 1.5 pro with normal prompt and json prompt\n\nCreate a charming, tactile stop-motion animation video in 4K featuring a quirky, retro-futuristic robot.\n\nVisuals: The video simulates a handcrafted claymation style mixed with \"found objects,\" explicitly showcasing the imperfections of the medium such as visible fingerprints on the clay and the slight, jerky \"stutter\" of movement between frames (stepped animation). The scene is set on a rustic, scratched wooden tabletop illuminated by warm, natural window light.\n\nAction: The sequence begins with a scattered pile of vintage brass buttons, rusty watch gears, bent screws, and lumps of colored modeling clay lying dormant. As the video progresses, these objects begin to magically wiggle and twitch. They then hop and self-assemble, piece by piece, into a small robot character—clay squishes around gears to form joints, and buttons snap into place as eyes. Upon completion of the assembly, the robot stabilizes and gives a final, slightly wobbly wave directly at the camera.\n\nAudio: The sound design is textural and intimate (ASMR-style). It highlights the specific materials: the metallic clatter of gears, the hollow click of buttons, and the distinct wet squishing sound of molding clay.\n\nTechnical: The camera remains largely static to ground the stop-motion effect, keeping the focus on the animated objects. The aesthetic is warm, nostalgic, and creative.\n\n#ad #reklam",
